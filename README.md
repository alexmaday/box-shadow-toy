## An Interactive Demo for CSS `box-shadow`

Just a small experiment to visualize how `box-shadow` works. My current model is a single box controlled through a single set attributes.

### NOTE: There already exists quite a nice box-shadow _generator_ [here.](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html)

TODO:

- JavaScript: There is a most basic skeleton. I've started to hook up some event listeners for each input[range]. It works, but it smells pretty bad. Remember this is version 0.01.
- Styling: layout breaks very easily, also there's no reason to have a border around the form's `fieldset`. Derp. Flexbox maybe?
- Range labels should include current value
  - look at some example forms using range attributes
- maybe add a reset button?
- maybe make box's color choice interactive
